# Business Need
The university wants to encourage academic excellence by offering scholarships to students with a certain GPA. A reliable calculator is needed to streamline the eligibility determination process.

# User Story
As a scholarship eligibility calculator developer, I want to determine whether a student is eligible for a scholarship based on their GPA. The application should provide a clear eligibility message for the user.

# Definition of Done
- Implement the scholarship eligibility logic using control structures (If statement and For loop).
- Display the eligibility status in a user-friendly manner.
